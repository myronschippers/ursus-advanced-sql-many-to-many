# Advanced SQL Many-to-Many

We looked at One-to-One & One-to-Many where the relational data got tucked into one of our two tables but now we are going to look at Many-to-Many where we have two separate tables of data that are connected by a third table holding all of the relational data. This third table is referred to as a **junction** table.
